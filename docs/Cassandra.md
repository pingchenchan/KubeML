# Cassandra Usage in this System: Architecture and Best Practices

## Cassandra Core Usage

- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:** The system uses two Cassandra nodes with a replication factor of 2, ensuring data is replicated across both nodes. Even if one node fails, the system remains operational, providing continuous service availability and fault tolerance.

- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** By utilizing chunking, compression, and partitioning strategies, large datasets are stored and retrieved efficiently. Data is broken into smaller chunks, reducing the overhead during reads and allowing for faster data retrieval.
- **Scalability:** The architecture allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more nodes. Data is distributed efficiently using partition-aware storage, ensuring low-latency reads and writes even as the dataset grows. 


## Design Considerations

- **Handling Large Datasets:** The system uses data chunking and partition-aware storage to efficiently manage and query large datasets, ensuring smooth performance during data ingestion and retrieval.
- **Minimizing Latency with Caching:** Integrating Redis provides low-latency access to frequently used datasets, enhancing the speed of model training and real-time data operations.
- **Ensuring High Availability and Fault Tolerance:** With a replication factor of 2, the system ensures data remains available even if one node fails, providing resilience against downtime and node failures.
- **Supporting Real-time Monitoring and Transparency:** Kafka integration enables real-time tracking of batch operations, providing continuous updates to users on the frontend via Server-Sent Events (SSE). This ensures immediate feedback during critical operations such as data loading and model training.
- **Scalable to Meet Future Growth:** The system's architecture supports horizontal scaling, allowing it to grow seamlessly as demand increases, ensuring continued performance under high data volumes and traffic.

## Best Practices in this System

- **Replication for High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Use a replication factor of 2 to replicate data across both nodes. Ensures the system remains operational even if one node becomes unavailable.
- **Optimize Data Caching with Redis**:  Cache frequently accessed datasets in Redis to minimize queries to Cassandra.  Reduces latency and improves response times for critical operations. 
- **Compression and Chunking for Efficient Batch Writes**: Compress data using gzip and divide it into chunks of 5MB or smaller to optimize write performance. Store all related data chunks within the same partition to improves write performance.  Ensures maximum write throughput while preventing memory overload during batch operations.
- **Real-time Feedback through Kafka Integration**: Use Kafka to track the progress of batch operations and stream real-time updates to the frontend via SSE.


## Conclusion
This Cassandra-based system integrates Redis caching and Kafka monitoring to deliver high availability, scalability, and efficient data retrieval. The replication strategy ensures fault tolerance, while Redis caching accelerates access to frequently used datasets. Partition-aware storage and compression enhance performance, making the system capable of handling large datasets and high traffic efficiently. This architecture supports real-time monitoring via Kafka, ensuring smooth operations and seamless scalability.
