Redis Usage in Your System: Architecture and Best Practices
Redis Usage
Caching of Datasets: Redis serves as an in-memory cache to store datasets (e.g., MNIST) used during model training. This avoids frequent access to the Cassandra database, improving the system’s performance and response time.
Data Retrieval Optimization: Redis is checked first when fetching datasets. If the data is not found in Redis, it triggers a query to Cassandra and the result is cached in Redis for future requests.
Temporary Data Storage: Redis enables fast, non-persistent storage of training data, which is sufficient for temporary usage, such as machine learning model training sessions.
Design Considerations
Performance Optimization: Storing frequently accessed datasets in Redis avoids repeated I/O operations with Cassandra, improving performance.
Low Latency Access: Redis provides fast access to data since it operates in memory. This supports real-time tasks such as streaming logs and training feedback.
Scalability and Fault Tolerance: While Redis is used as a cache and not as the primary data store, it enhances the system's scalability by reducing load on Cassandra.
Best Practices in Your Redis Setup
Efficient Caching Strategy with Pickle Serialization

Setup: Data is serialized with pickle before storing in Redis, ensuring complex data structures like NumPy arrays are properly handled.
Benefit: Ensures compatibility with Python objects, making it easy to store and retrieve large datasets efficiently.
Cache Validation and Fallback Mechanism

Setup: The system checks Redis first for datasets. If the data is not found, it queries Cassandra and then caches the result in Redis.
Benefit: Reduces redundant queries to the database, ensuring optimal use of resources while maintaining data availability.
Session-level Data Management for Memory Efficiency

Setup: Cached data is used only during the active session to prevent excessive memory consumption. Redis keys expire after use or can be manually removed.
Benefit: Helps prevent memory bloat, maintaining efficient use of the Redis cache.
Logging with Kafka Integration

Setup: Log messages regarding Redis operations (e.g., data retrieval, cache hits/misses) are sent to Kafka topics for tracking and real-time updates to the frontend via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
Benefit: Provides real-time visibility into the system’s operations, enhancing transparency and user experience.
Graceful Handling of Cache Misses

Setup: If data is not found in Redis, the system raises HTTP exceptions or logs errors, and the data is re-fetched from Cassandra.
Benefit: Ensures smooth handling of errors and maintains system reliability even if cache misses occur.
Redis Client Configuration for Scalability

Setup: The Redis client is initialized at the application level and reused across requests, reducing overhead. Redis is also configured to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
Benefit: Enhances performance and ensures the system can scale with increased load.
