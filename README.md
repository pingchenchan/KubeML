# Technical Document: Automated Machine Learning Model Selection and Training Platform Design

## Overview
This platform aims to provide users with a convenient service for selecting and training machine learning models. Users can choose example datasets and select classification tasks, and the system will automatically train suitable models and identify the best-performing one. The system uses Kubernetes to manage multiple containers, distribute model training workloads, and utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve data retrieval efficiency.

## Core Features
1. User Dataset Selection and Classification Task
    - Frontend: Provides a user interface using React, allowing users to upload tabular datasets and select classification tasks (e.g., binary or multiclass).
    - Technology Stack: React, TypeScript, MUI
    - Functionality:
      - File upload interface for users to select CSV, Excel, or other tabular dataset formats.
      - Dropdown menu or radio buttons for users to choose the type of classification task.

2. Master Node: Handles User Requests
    - Functionality: The master node is responsible for handling user requests, storing data in Cassandra, and coordinating the allocation of training tasks to worker nodes.
    - Technology Stack: Flask, Cassandra driver, Kafka
    - Process:
      - Receives user datasets and stores them in Cassandra.
      - Distributes training tasks to Kafka topics for worker nodes to subscribe to.

3. Cassandra: Data Storage
    - Functionality: Stores tabular datasets and provides efficient read and write operations suitable for large-scale data processing in distributed environments.
    - Technology Stack: Cassandra
    - Process:
      - User-uploaded datasets are stored in Cassandra and can be accessed using unique identifiers.
      - Each worker node reads data from Cassandra for training based on demand.

4. Worker Nodes: Distributed Model Training
    - Functionality: Worker nodes retrieve training tasks from Kafka, read data from Cassandra, and perform model training.
    - Technology Stack: Flask, Scikit-learn, Kafka driver, Redis
    - Process:
      - Each worker node attempts to read data from Redis cache, and if not available, reads it from Cassandra and caches it in Redis.
      - Multiple models are trained using Scikit-learn or other machine learning frameworks, and the results are sent back to Kafka topics.

5. Redis: Caching Layer
    - Functionality: Caches frequently accessed data to reduce the load on Cassandra and improve overall performance.
    - Technology Stack: Redis
    - Process:
      - Worker nodes first check if the required data exists in the Redis cache.
      - If the data is not in Redis, it is read from Cassandra and cached.
      - LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy is used to manage the cache to prevent memory overload.

6. Prometheus & Grafana: System Monitoring
    - Functionality: Monitors system status, resource usage, and model training progress.
    - Technology Stack: Prometheus, Grafana
    - Process:
      - Worker nodes and master node expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to periodically collect node status.
      - Grafana visualizes system resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) and model training progress.

## Recommended Development Order for Core Features
To ensure the system is built incrementally from core functionality and each stage's development results are independently testable, it is recommended to follow the dependency and critical module order. The suggested development order is as follows:

1. Design and implement data storage and management using Cassandra.
    - Set up a Cassandra cluster and design a data model for storing tabular datasets.
    - Develop basic database interaction APIs to support data read and write operations.
    - Test the performance of the Cassandra cluster to ensure stable data storage and retrieval.

2. Implement user upload and data storage functionality (frontend and master node).
    - Use React to build a simple frontend interface.
    - Develop the master node (Flask API) to receive datasets from the frontend and store them in Cassandra.
    - Ensure successful data transmission to the master node and correct writing to Cassandra.

3. Set up Kafka messaging system and implement task distribution.
    - Set up Kafka and configure a Kafka topic for distributing training tasks.
    - Integrate Kafka into the master node to push datasets and training tasks to the Kafka topic.
    - Test the proper functioning of the Kafka messaging system and ensure successful message delivery.

4. Implement worker nodes for model training.
    - Use Flask to build worker nodes that subscribe to training tasks from Kafka.
    - Use Scikit-learn or other machine learning frameworks to train models based on the read datasets (e.g., random forest, decision tree).
    - Test the worker nodes' ability to receive tasks from Kafka and perform model training.

5. Optimize data caching and retrieval using Redis.
    - Set up Redis and integrate it into the worker nodes to attempt data retrieval from Redis before accessing Cassandra.
    - If the data is not in Redis, read it from Cassandra and cache it in Redis.
    - Test the caching effectiveness of Redis and ensure improved data retrieval speed for frequently accessed data.

6. Implement system monitoring and visualization using Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Expose a `/metrics` endpoint in all nodes (master node and worker nodes) to provide runtime metrics.
    - Configure Prometheus to collect these metrics and visualize them in Grafana.
    - Test the visualization of system resources (CPU, memory) and model training progress.

## Conclusion
The recommended development order is as follows:
1. Cassandra: Data storage design and implementation
2. Frontend dataset upload and master node data storage functionality
3. Kafka messaging system design and task distribution
4. Worker nodes: Model training functionality implementation
5. Redis caching layer design and optimized data retrieval
6. Prometheus & Grafana: System monitoring and visualization
